      <description>Research Faculty The research interests of the more than forty program faculty include structure and function of nucleic acids, mechanisms of DNA replication, RNA transcription and mRNA translation, the structure and function of viruses, genes and gene products controlling cell cycle progression, cell death and development, protein trafficking, signal transduction, hormone receptors, and structural biology. To study these important and exciting fields, our faculty employ experimental systems such as bacteria, viruses, yeast cells, Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila, C.</description>
