<p>The research interests of the 40 program faculty include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the structure and function of nucleic acids</li>
<li>mechanisms of DNA replication, RNA transcription and mRNA translation
the structure and function of viruses
genes and gene products controlling cell cycle progression, cell death and development, protein trafficking, signal transduction, hormone receptors, and structural biology.</li>
</ul>

<p>To study these important and exciting fields, our faculty employ experimental systems bacteria, viruses, yeast cells, Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila, C. elegans, human tissue culture cells, and genetically engineered mice. Our faculty also provide training in high resolution structure of proteins and RNA/DNA by x-ray crystallography and NMR. Because of the solid funding record of all participating faculty, graduate students find unlimited opportunities to perform research in an atmosphere of both guidance and freedom.</p>
