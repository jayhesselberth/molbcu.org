The Molecular Biology Program is dedicated to providing rigorous training to its
students in a supportive environment. Molecular Biology faculty are members
of many different departments and are applying the techniques of molecular
biology to answer questions in diverse areas. Molecular biology, the science of
how living things work at the molecular level, has spearheaded the recent
revolution in our understanding of human disease and led to the birth of the
biotechnology industry. In almost all aspects of modern biomedical research, a
professional knowledge of molecular biology is essential. The training program
is designed to equip students for careers at the cutting edge of biology.

Students are supported from both private (Bolie Fund) and government (NIH T32)
training grants. As a testament to the program's success, our graduates have
been successful at securing positions in academic, government and industrial
settings.
