The Molecular Biology Program is dedicated to providing rigorous training to its
students in a supportive environment. Molecular Biology faculty are members
of many different departments and are applying the techniques of molecular
biology to answer questions in diverse areas. Molecular biology, the science of
how living things work at the molecular level, has led the recent
revolution in our understanding of human disease and gave birth to the
biotechnology industry. In almost all aspects of modern biomedical research, a
professional knowledge of molecular biology is essential. Our training program
is designed to equip students for careers at the cutting edge of biology.

Students are supported from both private (Bolie Fund) and government (NIH T32)
training grants. As a testament to our program's success, program graduates have
been successful at securing positions in academic, government and industrial
settings.
