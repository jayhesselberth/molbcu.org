# Research Faculty

The research interests of the 40 program faculty include:

- the structure and function of nucleic acids
- mechanisms of DNA replication, RNA transcription and mRNA translation
the structure and function of viruses
genes and gene products controlling cell cycle progression, cell death and development, protein trafficking, signal transduction, hormone receptors, and structural biology.

To study these important and exciting fields, our faculty employ experimental systems bacteria, viruses, yeast cells, Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila, C. elegans, human tissue culture cells, and genetically engineered mice. Our faculty also provide training in high resolution structure of proteins and RNA/DNA by x-ray crystallography and NMR. Because of the solid funding record of all participating faculty, graduate students find unlimited opportunities to perform research in an atmosphere of both guidance and freedom.

Potter, Huntington	
Our current research is devoted to laboratory and clinical investigation of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and trisomy 21/Down syndrome (DS), which also induces AD by age 40. We hypothesized and showed that AD patients develop trisomy 21 and other aneuploid cells, including neurons, during the course of their life and thus that AD is a mosaic form of DS.
