# Research Faculty

The research interests of the 40 program faculty include:

- the structure and function of nucleic acids
- mechanisms of DNA replication, RNA transcription and mRNA translation
- the structure and function of viruses

To study these important and exciting fields, our faculty employ experimental
systems bacteria, viruses, yeast cells, Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila, C. elegans,
human tissue culture cells, and genetically engineered mice. Our faculty also
provide training in high resolution structure of proteins and RNA/DNA by x-ray
crystallography and NMR. Because of the solid funding record of all
participating faculty, graduate students find unlimited opportunities to perform
research in an atmosphere of both guidance and freedom.
