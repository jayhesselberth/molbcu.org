# Program faculty

The research interests of program faculty span the breadth of molecular biology.

<!--more-->

The research interests of 69 program faculty include:

- Mechanisms of DNA replication, RNA transcription, and mRNA translation
- Cell biology of cell division

Our faculty employ experimental systems including bacteria, viruses, yeast
cells, Xenopus oocytes, Drosophila, C. elegans, human tissue culture cells, and
genetically engineered mice. Our faculty also provide training in high
resolution structure of proteins and RNA/DNA by x-ray crystallography and NMR.
Because of the solid funding record of all participating faculty, graduate
students find unlimited opportunities to perform research in an atmosphere of
both guidance and freedom.
