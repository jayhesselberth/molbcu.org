Denver is at the feet of the Rocky Mountains and is routinely ranked one of the best places to live in the country. Unfortunately Denver's rapid growth also means that rent and housing prices continue to rise. The Graduate School has a good [overview on Denver Life](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Graduate-School/prospective/Pages/colorado.aspx).

## Housing

- Graduate School-sponsored [housing survey](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/Graduate-School/prospective/Pages/housing.aspx).

## Stipend and benefits

Ph.D. students receive a stipend of $30,000 per year, paid in monthly installments on the last working day of each month. The Program also pays tuition, fees, and [health/dental insurance](http://www.ucdenver.edu/life/services/student-health/Pages/default.aspx) for the first year; these costs are paid by a student's chosen thesis mentor thereafter.

## Commuting

### Public transportation

The [Regional Transportation District (RTD)](http://www.rtd-denver.com/) provides light rail, commuter train, and bus services throughout the Denver metro area. The [RTD College Pass](http://www.rtd-denver.com/CollegePass.shtml) is free of charge to all active Molecular Biology Ph.D. students and includes unlimited rides on all regular fixed routes including the [University of Colorado A Line](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/a-line.shtml) to Denver International Airport. The A Lineâ€™s Peoria station is a 5 minute drive from campus, and accessible via RTD's 121 bus line.

The [CU Anschutz Medical Campus Rail Shuttle](http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/departments/FacilitiesManagement/Pages/railshuttle.aspx) provides regular service to Fitzsimmons Station on the R Line. A convenient option for traveling to Boulder is RTD's [Flatiron Flyer](http://www.rtd-denver.com/flatiron-flyer.shtml), which connects the Anschutz campus to the downtown Boulder station by bus.

The free [intercampus shuttle](http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/departments/FacilitiesManagement/ParkingMaps/Pages/ShuttleService.aspx) makes hourly stops on weekdays at the Anschutz Medical Campus, the VA Medical Center, National Jewish Health, and the Auraria campus in downtown Denver.

### Parking 

Students who wish to park on campus during business hours can purchase a standard parking pass ($38/month) or a pass to the nearby Rock Lot ($12/month). No cost permits for after hours and weekend parking are also available. Answers to some frequently asked questions about student parking can be found [here](http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/departments/FacilitiesManagement/Documents/Parking/COMMONLY%20ASKED%20QUESTIONS%20Student%202017.pdf).

## Fun

For winter sports lovers, Denver is the gateway to some of the best skiing and snowboarding in the country, with many popular mountains within a 1-3 hour drive. CU Anschutz Student Senate sponsors a SkiDaze event in late September where students can purchase discounted packs of ski lift tickets or season passes.
