**The Molecular Biology Program** is dedicated to providing rigorous training to
its students in a supportive environment. Molecular Biology faculty are members
of many departments and answering questions in diverse areas. Molecular biology
--- the science of how organisms work at the molecular level --- has spearheaded
the recent revolution in our understanding of human disease and led to the birth
of the biotechnology industry.

Our training program equips students for careers at the cutting edge of biology.
Students are supported from both private and federal training grants. As a
testament to the program's success, our graduates have been successful at
securing positions in academic, government, and industrial settings.
