**The Molecular Biology Program** is dedicated to providing rigorous training to
its students in a supportive environment. Molecular Biology faculty are members
of many different departments who are applying the techniques of molecular
biology to answer questions in diverse areas. Molecular biology --- the science
of how organisms work at the molecular level --- has spearheaded the recent
revolution in our understanding of human disease and led to the birth of the
biotechnology industry. In almost all aspects of modern biomedical research, a
professional knowledge of Molecular biology is essential.

Our training program is designed to equip students for careers at the cutting
edge of biology. Students are supported from both private (Bolie Fund) and
government (NIH T32) training grants. As a testament to the program's success,
our graduates have been successful at securing positions in academic,
government, and industrial settings.
