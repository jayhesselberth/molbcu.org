## About the Scholarship

In 2001, the MOLB program received an endowment, the “Victor and Earleen Bolie Scholarship Fund”, from a private benefactor ([Dr. Victor Bolie](http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Membership/Obituaries/Bolie.html)). The endowment was initially designated for travel awards for program students to attend and present their work at national/international scientific conferences.  In 2011, Dr. Bolie passed away and left an additional and generous endowment to the program.  Beginning in fall 2013, the Bolie endowment began to support a portion of the annual stipend for 3 students per year, along with $2000 for educational expenses.  Bolie Graduate Scholars are selected from 4th, 5th and 6th year students.
