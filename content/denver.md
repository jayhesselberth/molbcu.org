## Public transportation

The [Regional Transportation District (RTD)](http://www.rtd-denver.com/) provides light rail, commuter train, and bus services throughout the Denver metro area. The [RTD College Pass](http://www.rtd-denver.com/CollegePass.shtml) is free of charge to all active Molecular Biology Ph.D. students and includes unlimited rides on all regular fixed routes including the [University of Colorado A Line](http://www3.rtd-denver.com/a-line.shtml) to Denver International Airport. The A Lineâ€™s Peoria station is a 5 minute drive from campus, and accessible via RTD's 121 bus line.

The [CU Anschutz Medical Campus Rail Shuttle](http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/departments/FacilitiesManagement/Pages/railshuttle.aspx) provides regular service to Fitzsimmons Station on the R Line. A convenient option for traveling to Boulder is RTD's [Flatiron Flyer](http://www.rtd-denver.com/flatiron-flyer.shtml), which connects the Anschutz campus to the downtown Boulder station by bus.

The free [intercampus shuttle](http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/departments/FacilitiesManagement/ParkingMaps/Pages/ShuttleService.aspx) makes hourly stops on weekdays at the Anschutz Medical Campus, the VA Medical Center, National Jewish Health, and the Auraria campus in downtown Denver.

## Fun

For winter sports lovers, Denver is the gateway to some of the best skiing and snowboarding in the country, with many popular mountains within a 1-3 hour drive. CU Anschutz Student Senate sponsors a SkiDaze event in late September where students can purchase discounted packs of ski lift tickets or season passes.
